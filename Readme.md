# LSDG Website

This is a very simple LSDG website to serve as a launchpad for a more-complete site. Since we're a development group,
the idea is to get people to fork this project, and add features to it, and send us pull requests.

# Design

This is a very simple, bare-bones node project that serves static webpages. If you want it to do more than that, or
want to add a page, fork it!
